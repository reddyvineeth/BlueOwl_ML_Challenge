# BlueOwl_ML_Challenge

It is an insurance data given by BlueOwl to build a model on a extremely imbalanced data.

Performed oversampling techniques to improve the minority classes and balance with the majority classes.

The process took three different algorithms to improve the AUC for the model.

Performed hyperparameter tuning process iteratively using GridsearchCV to idetify the best parameters to eradicate the overfitting in the model.

Finally compared the AUC-ROC scores visually of all the models and showed that the XGBoost has the greater performance.
